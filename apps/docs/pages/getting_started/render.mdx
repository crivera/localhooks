- **Root Directory**: Enter `apps/server`
- **Build Command**: Enter `npm i && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: Enter `npm run start:prod`

<Callout type="warning">

### Done

You can now point any webhooks (i.e. [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Clerk](https://clerk.com), etc...) for development/staging purposes to the URL from Step 5 and append `/message`.

<Callout type="info">
  For example: https://server.localhooks.dev/message
</Callout>

</Steps>

### Shared Instances

If you're collaborating on the instance with others, such as a development team, you can employ channels to avoid interfering with each other's work. Simply add any value (up to 20 characters) as a route param to the `/message` endpoint.

<Callout type="info">
  For example: https://server.localhooks.dev/message/chris-rivera

Use a UUID to make sure to not clash with another channel.
