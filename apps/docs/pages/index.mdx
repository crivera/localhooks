# Transforming Local Webhooks Testing

LocalHooks is an **innovative product** designed to **transform the way developers test webhooks locally**. Crafted with the needs of developers in mind, LocalHooks provides a seamless solution that allows free testing of webhooks locally without the hassle of complex setups or high costs.

## How LocalHooks Works

LocalHooks takes advantage of the free instance from [**render.com**](https://render.com/pricing) to deploy a "server", enabling developers to connect and perform tests with ease. By leveraging the power of **CLI**, LocalHooks ensures a seamless connection that requires no prerequisite knowledge or manual configuration.

1. Deploy your server with LocalHooks on [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect through the CLI using npx
3. Point your webhooks to 1 never changing URL
4. Start testing

## Your New Testing Tool

Our primary goal is to streamline the development process, eliminating the time and effort developers would traditionally need to invest in setting up and managing local servers for testing webhooks.

Now, with LocalHooks, you can focus on what matters most - **writing and refining your code, not setting up the infrastructure.**

## Experience Freedom with LocalHooks - Completely Free

In our commitment to support developers and make the testing process as simple as possible, we are proud to offer LocalHooks as a **completely free tool**.

No hidden fees, no paywalls, and no costly upgrades.

Our philosophy is simple: powerful tools should be accessible and affordable to all developers, regardless of budget. This is why weâ€™ve partnered with **render.com** to allow deployment of a "server" on their free instance.

This is our promise to you: with LocalHooks, you'll have a **free, robust, and reliable tool** at your disposal to test webhooks locally. Enjoy the freedom to create, test, and refine without the burden of unnecessary costs.
